# HelpingHands
This project "HelpingHands" is a web design project. Basically it is a web application made through the tech stacks - HTML, CSS, JavaScript. This was my first web project, and it's objective was to learn the flow of a website and learn web development languages. This project was a group project, I along with my batchmate had developed this web application.
