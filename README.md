# HelpingHands
This project "HelpingHands" is a web design project. Basically it is a web application made through the tech stacks - HTML, CSS, JavaScript. This was my first web project, and it's objective was to learn the flow of a website and learn web development languages. This project was a group project, I along with my batchmate had developed this web application.

## Problem Statement

The economic impact of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in India has been largely disruptive. 
India's growth in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2020 went down to 3.1% according to the 
Ministry of Statistics. Many businesses running at tertiary sector are also affected by pandemic 
and not at a very good position. And even many of the citizens of India are not able to fulfill their 
basic needs for survival because of not getting enough goods and unemployment.

<br />

## Aim

To make a difference in economic growth and provide the necessary items across various homes, 
designing a digital solution for the problems mentioned above so that each and every citizen can 
fulfill their basic needs with necessary items.
